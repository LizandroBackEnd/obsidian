Design patterns are reusable and proven solutions to common problems that occur in software development. These patterns provide a standard structure for addressing recurring issues in software design architecture, promoting best practices and facilitating communication between developers.  
There are three main types of design patterns:

1. **Creational patterns**: These focus on how objects are created, helping to make object creation more flexible and reusable. Examples include:
    
    - **Singleton**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it.
    - **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.
2. **Structural patterns**: These deal with the composition of classes and objects, helping to ensure that systems are easy to extend and maintain. Examples include:
    
    - **Adapter**: Allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.
    - **Decorator**: Adds functionality to an object dynamically without altering its structure.
3. **Behavioral patterns**: These focus on communication between objects and how they collaborate with each other. Examples include:
    
    - **Observer**: Allows an object to notify other objects when its state changes.
    - **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms and allows them to be swapped at runtime.
