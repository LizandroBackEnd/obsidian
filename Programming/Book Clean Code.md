"Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin teaches how to write high-quality code that is readable, maintainable, and efficient. The author emphasizes the importance of writing code that not only works but is also easy for other programmers to understand and modify. The book covers key principles such as simplicity, using clear names for variables and functions, organizing code into small, logical pieces, and eliminating duplication. It also provides practical examples of "bad code" (poorly written) and how to refactor it into "clean code."
