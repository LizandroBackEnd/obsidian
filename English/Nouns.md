Nouns are words we use to identify people, places, objects, animals, or ideas. They are essential in sentences because they usually represent who is doing the action (the subject) or who is receiving the action (the object). 
There are different types of nouns: 
1. COMMON NOUNS: These are general words for people, things, or places. Examples:  
- "City", "Book" 
2. Proper nouns: These refer to specific names of people, places or things, and they always start with a capital letter. Examples 
- "London", "John" 
3. Countable nouns: These are nouns that can be counted. Examples: 
- "Apple", "Car" 
4. Uncountable nouns: These refer to things that cannot be counted individually. Examples: 
- "Water", "Music" 
5. Concrete nouns: These refer to physical things that you can perceive with your senses. Examples: 
- "Chair", "Dog" 
6. Abstract nouns: These refer to ideas or concepts that do not have a physical existence. Examples: 
- "Freedom", "Happiness"
